							<p>TAZ and her two dog friends were accepted into foster care twice, out of a domestic violence situation.  A short time after she was reunited with her owner for the second time, she was thrown out of a car by her owner's abuser in the middle of a busy Phoenix intersection.  She made her way to a nearby convenience store.  A truck driver picked her up and called The Last Resort, Inc. to tell the sad story (she was still wearing one of our identification tags).  He intended to adopt her as she had ridden along with him the whole day. We knew TAZ would never be safe with her owner, so we agreed. Unfortunately, she ate his wife's photo album and gnawed on their sofa.  The honeymoon was over.  He brought her back to us on a midnight run to Tucson.   We twice more tried to adopt her.  She was too lively for one, and too big for another.  Finally, she met Daniel and she was just right.</p>

							<p>Cyril has a mental disability.  He was being evicted.  He needed a placement for his two gentle giants, BRANDY and CHANCE.  We found a last minute placement for them with a woman we had helped several years earlier.  She was now in a position to help someone as she had once been helped.</p>

							<p>Mike's sister called and asked us to take BORIS, her brother's ferret. He needed residential treatment for his alcohol abuse, but no facility would allow BORIS to accompany him and he refused to go unless he could be assured BORIS would be safe during long-term treatment. Treatment was successful. Shortly after Mike and BORIS were reunited, Mike helped us find a placement for an abandoned dog we found near our main facility. </p>

							<p>When Cenobia was arrested, her longtime companion DOMINO was with her. Frightened by the commotion, he jumped from her car, and climbed up a pole. DOMINO was arrested too, by responding animal control officers, and taken to the pound.  With DOMINO'S time running out, a Last Resort representative met Cenobia at the jail where she signed a foster care contract.  He was immediately bailed out and taken to our main facility.  A short time later he was reunited with his mom and he has been instrumental in her rehabilitation.</p>

The Last Resort flew MAXX from Arizona to Washington State where he was reunited with his family.</p>

							<p>KANAKA, an African gray parrot, was as much a victim of domestic violence as her owner Phyllis. In a fit of rage, the abuser mutilated KANAKA. He ripped her sensitive beak until she was bleeding, crying in pain and unable to feed herself. Weeks after the attack, Phyllis was still feeding Kanaka by hand. Kanaka's suffering was the last straw and gave Phyllis the courage to leave her abuser forever. She surreptitiously planned her escape. When the time was right, she sought refuge at a women's shelter after making arrangements for Kanaka's placement at The Last Resort. Kanaka's beak slowly began to re-grow. Today Kanaka is thriving and has been reunited with Phyllis.</p>
